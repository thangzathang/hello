    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <h1>So i made at least 2 changes</h1>
    <h1>This is the third change</h1>
    Hello, World!
    <h2>This is a change without git add; We will simply git commit -am "message" which I am told is 
        the same as git add and git commit at the same time. Hopefully I refrsh my server repo and see this 
        message.
