    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <h1>So i made at least 2 changes</h1>
    <h1>This is the third change</h1>
    Hello, World!
    <h2>This is a change without git add; We will simply git commit -am "message" which I am told is 
        the same as git add and git commit at the same time. Hopefully I refrsh my server repo and see this 
        message.
    </h2>
    <h3>Before writing this h3 code and the words right now, I have done a git add hello.html. This supposedly 
        "watches" for changes in the given file. Now, after this, all that is needed is git commit -m and then 
        a final push.
    </h3>
    <h4>SO this message is for testing the theory of whether you git add before or after, after it seems 
        even though the guy on the harvard lecture seems to do it before. Nvm then. I will add, commit and then push now.
