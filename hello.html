    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <h1>So i made at least 2 changes</h1>
    <h1>This is the third change</h1>
    Hello, World!
    <h2>This is a change without git add; We will simply git commit -am "message" which I am told is 
        the same as git add and git commit at the same time. Hopefully I refrsh my server repo and see this 
        message.
    </h2>
    <h3>Before writing this h3 code and the words right now, I have done a git add hello.html. This supposedly 
        "watches" for changes in the given file. Now, after this, all that is needed is git commit -m and then 
        a final push.
    </h3>
    <h4>SO this message is for testing the theory of whether you git add before or after, after it seems 
        even though the guy on the harvard lecture seems to do it before. Nvm then. I will add, commit and then push now.

    <h2>This is a line of text made from github editor to demonstrate the GIT PULL!!</h2>
    <h2>This is another line of code made from github editor, I thought the pull would be harder than the push but the pull is much easier 
    and hopefully this is true in other crucial areas of my life.</h2>

    <h1>Merge Conflicts</h1>
    <p>To demonstrate merge conflict, we will use the header below. Local repository/ vscode will add 2 exclamation marks
        but then github editor will add a style of color red. Ultimately, we will have a merge conflict.
